Abstract = {Andalucia is a southern European LFR (less-favoured region)
with a high degree of self-government that has allowed it to design its
own H&D policies that complement those implemented throughout Spain and
the European Union (EU). Recently the Regional Government passed the
Third Andalucian Research Plan 2000-2003, an R&D planning instrument
that, as has become customary in previous Plans, attributes considerable
budgetary weight to the scientific aspects of the
science-technology-industry system (Andalucia allocates more of Us own
resources to promoting research than any other region in Spain). That
paper provides deeper insight into the role played by science in driving
the technological development of Andalucia, one of the LFRs of the EU.
The aim was to answer live fundamental questions: How is basic science
utilized by industry in Andalucia? Which sectors are the most dynamic in
Ike employment of scientific know-how? Which scientific fields are most
in demand by industry? Which type},
