AB  - Andalucia is a southern European LFR (less-favoured region) with a high degree of self-government that has allowed it to design its own H&D policies that complement those implemented throughout Spain and the European Union (EU). Recently the Regional Government passed the Third Andalucian Research Plan 2000-2003, an R&D planning instrument that, as has become customary in previous Plans, attributes considerable budgetary weight to the scientific aspects of the science-technology-industry system (Andalucia allocates more of Us own resources to promoting research than any other region in Spain). That paper provides deeper insight into the role played by science in driving the technological development of Andalucia, one of the LFRs of the EU. The aim was to answer live fundamental questions: How is basic science utilized by industry in Andalucia? Which sectors are the most dynamic in Ike employment of scientific know-how? Which scientific fields are most in demand by industry? Which types of institution utilize scientific knowledge most profusely? What delay is there in incorporating science into technology? The methodology that has been applied for investigating the links between science and technology is based on scientific citations in patents documents (NPC). The results in this article provide relevant information about the interconnection of scientific and technological systems and thus constitute a good point of reference for the development of future R&D plans.
