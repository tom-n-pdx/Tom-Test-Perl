AB In the initial stage of product design, it is essential to define
   product specifications according to various market niches. An important
   issue in this process is to provide designers with sufficient design
   knowledge to find out what customers really want. This paper proposes a
   data mining method to facilitate this task. The method focuses on
   mining association rules that reflect the mapping relationship between
   customer needs and product specifications. Four objectives, support,
   confidence, interestingness and comprehensibility, are used for
   evaluating the extracted rules. To solve such a multi-objective
   problem, a Pareto-based GA is utilized to perform the rule extraction.
   Through computational experiments on an electrical bicycle case, it is
   shown that our approach is capable of extracting useful and interesting
   knowledge from a design database.

AB Reliability has been regarded as an evaluation criterion in production
   configuration, the key step in mass customization. In this article, the
   authors focus on the integration of reliability analysis and
   configuration at the component level. Possible failure causes obtained
   with a fault tree analysis (FTA) are mapped to the product
   configuration network model via a functional model and a limitation
   matrix. Next, when a configuration scheme is generated through
   intersection of a connection matrix and a generation matrix, its
   reliability can be achieved with the integrated FTA so to compare with
   those of other schemes in optimization. Such an integration method is
   also adaptable for situations where the original fault tree is changed,
   and several fault trees are involved together. Finally, an example of
   configuring a laptop computer is used to illustrate the whole
   integration process.

AB Product configuration is a process of selecting suitable and compatible
   components for a product, arranging them, and then seeking one or more
   optimal options. To date, many researchers have studied its modelling,
   representing methods, and optimising approaches. However, uncertainty
   while involving new components, uncertain factors in supply chain and
   market, and imprecision and vagueness in customer requirements for
   configuration are always ignored. This paper identifies the uncertainty
   in configuration and proposes a fuzzy multi-objective optimisation
   algorithm to seek an optimal configuration scheme considering
   uncertainty. Multi-objective evaluation criteria are utilised to assess
   lifecycle cost, time to market, and serviceability of configuration
   options, Pareto optimality is applied to resolve conflicts between
   different configuration goals, a fuzzy set method is used to deal with
   imprecise estimated parameter values and a two-aspect judgment is
   proposed to balance expected values and worst case values in
   configuration. Compatibilities between components are also considered.
   The importance of optimisation objectives is determined according to
   different customers' requirements, and the desired configuration option
   is obtained through comparing the results. Finally, the effectiveness
   of the proposed method is illustrated through a case of configuring
   laptop computers, and a sensitivity analysis.

AB Purpose - The main purposes of this paper are to enhance the
   understanding of commonality models in manufacturing resource planning
   by documenting the current state of affairs and to stimulate fruitful
   future research by identifying gaps between the relevant issues and the
   available academic literature.
   Methodology - This paper is based on a comprehensive review of the
   articles from authentic publications on resources commonality or the
   various product mixes and the pertinent models. The papers are analysed
   to identify the current scenarios and draw future research directions
   in the area.
   Findings - The use of common components for different products in a
   company is important for managing product variety and maintaining
   competitiveness in this age of mass customisation and supply chain
   management struggles. The paper finds that the development of a
   mathematical model to study the effects of commonality in multistage
   systems with multiple products and multiple common items remains in the
   virgin area of research. Effects of uncertainty factors on the models
   are other issues not yet covered in the literature. Experiments and
   empirical studies in this gap also need further attention.
   Originality/Value - The contribution of this paper is to provide a
   summary of the current state of affairs in component commonality and
   its models and predict the future research trends. This review also

TI Modularity analysis and commonality design: a framework for the
   top-down platform and product family design
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH

DE product development; product family design; modularity; commonality

   INDEXES
AB With a highly fragmented market and increased competition,
   platform-based product family design is recognised as an effective
   method for constructing a product line that satisfies diverse customer
   demand while keeping design and production cost- and time-effective.
   Recognising the need for modularity and commonality in platform
   development, this paper presents a systematic framework to assist in
   implementing top-down platform and product family design, which aims to
   achieve system-level modularity for variety generation, and rationalise
   the commonality configuration for module instantiation. In the first
   phase of platform development, a robust and flexible product family
   architecture is constructed to accommodate variations by analysing the
   external varieties of the generic product architecture, and provide a
   modularity design space, wherein the design tasks are further
   decomposed into module instantiation. The second phase of detailed
   platform development aims to enhance commonality in terms of
   engineering efficiency by coordinating with the back-end product
   realisation stage. A tractable optimisation method is used to capture
   and resolve the trade-off between commonality configuration and
   individual product performance. A family of power tool designs is used
   to demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed framework
   at the system level and detailed design stages.

AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has proven useful in comparing the
   environmental impact of alternatives, life-cycle phases or parts in a
   product. To date, benchmarking a new product with previous
   environmental information entails a degree of subjectivity. This paper
   presents LCP-families, a concept to develop reference ranges for
   environmental impact of a new product. A new product can be catalogued
   as environmentally better or worse than a percentage of its
   competitors, depending on what position it occupies in its LCP-family.
   Three case studies of packaging products are carried out to show the
   applicability and usefulness of the concepts presented. (C) 2009

AB In this paper, the authors have investigated the effects components
   commonality and uncertainty in lead time, machine breakdown, etc. in a
   manufacturing environment. The production is characterized by multiple
   end items for multi-period and multi-stage dependent demand. The
   delivery performances, throughput of the finished products and average
   production time in the system are examined for different experimental
   scenarios with reference to an existing manufacturing setting. A
   simulation package, namely WITNESS is used to simulate/analyze the
   situations of the production lines. Simulation models are developed and
   these are verified and validated with the historical data collected
   from the company. It is observed that inclusion of common components in
   the manufacturing system is generally beneficial over the
   non-commonality environment, especially i) in uncertain situations, ii)
   for long procurement lead time of components and iii) when the number
   of parts increase in the system. Impacts of machine breakdown on system
   outcomes are higher than that of the lead time variation. The
   combination of uncertain factors has more impact on outcomes
   (throughput and average production time) compared to the individual
   factor. Commonality has a better control over the machine breakdown
   than lead time uncertainty.

AB The paper focuses on modelling and solving a design problem, namely the
   selection of a set of modules to be manufactured at one or more distant
   sites and shipped to a proximity site for final assembly subject to
   time constraints. The problem is modelled as a mathematical one, and
   solved by an appropriately designed genetic algorithm enhanced with a
   modified crossover operation, a uniform mutation with adaptive rate and
   a partial reshuffling procedure. The actual design problem is solved
   with 17 components. Larger problems may be solved without modifying the
   modelling steps, although they may require variation in terms of
   processing time, depending on the constraints that exist between the
   components.

AB Quite a few investigations have been carried out on modularity in
   product development. However, the presence of various perspectives,
   representations, and different problems hamper a holistic comprehension
   of modular products development (MPD) or modularity. This article is
   developed to give a deeper understanding of MPD. An evolutionary
   history of modularity, consisting of five stages, is introduced. The
   relationships among the benefits of modularity, such as cost-reduction,
   diversity, and innovation ability are then discussed in detail along
   with their relationships to related research issues. The implementation
   aspect of MPD is explained in three tiers: central, mediate, and
   peripheral. It shows that former theories and methods can hardly meet
   the needs of MPD application in real practice, and that metrics and
   measurement cannot take into account the degree of modularity, and
   cost-reduction becomes unclear and more complex. Based on this, a new
   powerful approach with 15 convenient steps for MPD is presented and
   compared with former reported research results. Also, recommendations
   for future research have been suggested.

AB This paper presents a framework for finding optimal modules in a
   delayed product differentiation scenario. Historical product sales data
   is utilized to estimate demand probability and customer preferences.
   Then this information is used by a multiple-objective optimization
   model to form modules. An evolutionary computation approach is applied
   to solve the optimization model and find the Pareto-optimal solutions.
   An industrial case study illustrates the ideas presented in the paper.
   The mean number of assembly operations and expected pre-assembly costs
   are the two competing objectives that are optimized in the case study.
   The mean number of assembly operations can be significantly reduced
   while incurring relatively small increases in the expected pre-assembly
   cost. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

DE Multidisciplinary design optimization; Reconfigurable machining system;

ID ARCHITECTURE; FAMILY; TOOL
AB A reconfigurable machining system is usually a modularized system, and
   its configuration design concerns the selections of modules and the
   determination of geometric dimensions in some specific modules. All of
   its design perspectives from kinematics, dynamics, and control have to
   be taken into considerations simultaneously, and a multidisciplinary
   design optimization (MDO) tool is required to support the configuration
   design process. This paper presents a new MDO tool for reconfigurable
   machining systems, and it includes the following works: (i) the
   literatures on the computer-aided design of reconfigurable parallel
   machining systems have been reviewed with a conclusion that the
   multidisciplinary design optimization is essential, but no
   comprehensive design tool is available to reconfigurable parallel
   machining systems; (ii) a class of reconfigurable systems called
   reconfigurable tripod-based machining system has been introduced, its
   reconfiguration problem is identified, and the corresponding design
   criteria have been discussed; (iii) design analysis in all of the
   disciplines including kinematics, dynamics, and control have been taken
   into considerations, and design models have been developed to evaluate
   various design candidates; in particular, the innovative solutions to
   direct kinematics, stiffness analysis for the design configurations of
   tripod-based machines with a passive leg, and concise dynamic modelling
   have been provided; and (iv) A design optimization approach is proposed
   to determine the best solution from all possible configurations. Based
   on the works presented in this paper, a computer-aided design and
   control tool have been implemented to support the system
   reconfiguration design and control processes. Some issues relevant to
   the practical implementation have also been discussed. (C) 2009

TI Innovations in Design Through Transformation: A Fundamental Study of
   Transformation Principles
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
LA English
DT Review
DE design principles; transformational design; design transformation
   theory; inductive research; deductive research
ID PRODUCT PLATFORM DESIGN; COMMONALITY; FAMILY; ARCHITECTURE
AB The act of creating a new product, system, or process is an innovation;
   the result of excogitation, study and experimentation. It is an
   inductive and/or deductive process. The inductive process involves
   studying systems that exist, for example, in nature, patents and
   products, and inducing from the behavior of these systems elemental
   features for innovating novel products. The deductive process involves
   deducing such aspects from hypothetical concepts and situations where
   systems or products could exist. By the application of a combined
   inductive and deductive approach, this paper reports on a methodology
   for the creation of innovative products with a broader functional
   repertoire than traditional designs. This breed of innovative products
   is coined as transformers, transforming into different configurations
   or according to different states. Current design theory lacks a
   systematic methodology for the creation of products that have the
   ability to transform. This paper identifies analogies in nature,
   patents, and products along with hypothesizing the existence of such
   products in different environments and situations. Transformation
   design principles are extracted by studying key design features and
   functional elements that make up a transforming product. These
   principles are defined and categorized according to their roles in
   general transformations. The principles and categorizations are then
   validated and applied to conceptualize transforming products as part of
   an innovative design process. [DOI: 10.1115/1.3125205]

ID PLATFORM DESIGN; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CUSTOMIZATION
AB Manufacturing enterprises are under competitive pressure to provide
   adequate product variety in order to meet diverse customer requirements
   while striving to reduce cost and time to market by employing product
   commonality and modularity. One successful approach to mass
   customisation (MC) is to design a family of product variants
   simultaneously to strike the optimum balance between commonality and
   differentiability. This paper formulates product family design as a
   multiobjective optimisation problem. A new method is proposed for
   assessing multi-level commonality at the product, module, component and
   even parameter levels. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MEA) is
   proposed based on NSGA-II to solve this problem. This method uses a
   special scheme to represent and track the problem and its solutions.
   The effectiveness of the approach is first tested through a
   mathematical problem and then demonstrated with an industrial case of
   gantry crane family design. Computational experiments show favourable
   results and benefits of the proposed MEA-based product family design
   method.

ID PRODUCT
AB Design is the foremost step in the development of any
   electro-mechanical product. One limitation of existing design tools is
   that they only focus either on the initial design phase such as
   customer needs gathering, or on the later phases such as design
   embodiment or detailed design phase. As a result, there are very few
   existing computational tools to aid the designers at the conceptual
   design stage. The proposed research seeks to eliminate this drawback by
   providing a computerised conceptual design framework that incorporates
   Modularity, design for assembly (DFA) and design for variety (DFV)
   principles. Conceptual design alternatives obtained from the proposed
   research framework are ranked based on minimum assembly time, and are
   composed of modules in such a way that future changes in customer needs
   are satisfied only by replacing certain modules. This paper provides a
   detailed discussion of the proposed framework obtained by amalgamating
   Modularity, DFA, and DFV. Working of the framework is also demonstrated
   with the help of an electronic toothbrush design example.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION
AB As a new business model, mass customization (MC) intends to enable
   enterprises to comply with customer requirements at mass production
   efficiencies. A widely advocated approach to implement MC is platform
   product customization (PPC). In this approach, a product variant is
   derived from a given product platform to satisfy customer requirements.
   Adaptive PPC is such a PPC mode in which the given product platform has
   a modular architecture where customization is achieved by swapping
   standard modules and/or scaling modular components to formulate
   multiple product variants according to market segments and customer
   requirements. Adaptive PPC optimization includes structural
   configuration and parametric optimization. This paper presents a new
   method, namely, a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CCEA), to solve
   the two interrelated problems of structural configuration and
   parametric optimization in adaptive PPC. The performance of the
   proposed algorithm is compared with other methods through a set of
   computational experiments. The results show that CCEA outperforms the
   existing hierarchical evolutionary approaches, especially for
   large-scale problems tested in the experiments. From the experiments,
   it is also noticed that CCEA is slow to converge at the beginning of
   evolutionary process. This initial slow convergence property of the
   method improves its searching capability and ensures a high quality
   solution.

AB A known strategy to implement Mass Customization is Product
   Modularization. To take advantage of the benefits of modularity, the
   selection of a common platform is required. This selection must be done
   with optimization criteria based on functionality and economics. In
   this paper we propose metaheuristic procedures to solve the problem of
   selecting a common platform for a modular product. This selection is
   based on an aggregate objective function that combines product
   performance and manufacturing cost. The problem is divided into two
   hierarchical problems that must be solved sequentially. The
   mathematical models have a non-linear integer formulation. Because of
   the computational complexity to solve optimally these models,
   metaheuristic procedures are proposed to solve each sub-problem. These
   procedures are based on Scatter Search and Tabu Search. A case study is
   presented with a small instance that is solved with these procedures
   and by total enumeration. The results of the metaheuristic procedures
   coincide with the optimal values found by total enumeration. The run
   times are reasonable and it is expected a greater benefit for a larger
   instance with similar results quality.

ID DESIGN
AB Configuration design has been recognized as an effective means to
   implement mass customization. Traditional configuration technologies
   mostly focus on practices from an engineering perspective on the basis
   of constraint and experience, yet leave the customer's viewpoints
   intact. In this paper, a new optimization approach for customer-driven
   product configuration is proposed. Configuration space is firstly
   established as the foundation for targeting diversity of customer needs
   and utility function is then employed to model and measure customer
   preference. Subsequently, a mathematic model that maximizes the ratio
   between overall utility and cost from both perspectives of customers
   and manufacturers is formulated, and a genetic algorithm is adopted to
   solve the combinatory optimization problem wherein the nested encoding
   scheme and multiple constraints handling are incorporated to improve
   the performance of configuration solving. A case study of a notebook
   computer is reported to demonstrate that the proposed approach provides
   an effective means for ATO manufacturing enterprises to deliver the
   optimal configuration solution.

AB In this paper we present a computational approach to the integration of
   mass customization into the design of novel solutions. We propose the
   use of entropy as a function of the diversity of solutions that can be
   generated within a design space. This work demonstrates that the
   potential of design systems to generate novel solutions can be
   estimated using complexity measures. This principle is implemented in
   an evolutionary system for the design of automotive instrument panels
   that display situation-relevant information in configurations that
   adapt to traffic conditions and driving actions. This sample
   application shows that the application of complexity maximization as a
   selection criterion in evolutionary design systems yields a large
   variety of solutions of high fitness. We also present guidelines for
   future developments.

TI Supplier integration and communication strategies in collaborative

ID PRODUCT FAMILY; DESIGN; MODULARITY
AB Following the introduction of platform-based products, especially
   considering that platforms are used for multiple brands, there is
   certainly a growing need for system engineering processes and
   techniques. This is further emphasized by the fact that companies faced
   with collaborative platform development frequently need to harmonize
   often opposing claims from stakeholders with different backgrounds,
   beliefs, desires and intentions. A core strategy for using resources (
   e. g., work-hours, knowledge, and production systems) better and more
   flexibly is to involve suppliers earlier in the development cycle. From
   this perspective, well-designed and efficiently managed supplier
   integration is a huge competitive advantage. Supplier integration may
   range from component design and manufacture to full responsibility for
   the design of complex distributed systems. The starting point for this
   work is the results from a previous study, made by the authors, in
   which a Swedish automotive company and one of its sub-suppliers were
   examined in order to identify communication barriers. This revealed
   several problems regarding supplier interaction and information
   management in projects where both suppliers and product owners
   contribute their unique knowledge. Following the previous study, the
   questions to answer include: How can platforms be represented to suit
   suppliers as well as orginal equipment manufacturers? How does one
   guarantee efficient, accurate and secure information exchange between
   the parties involved? Consequently, this article pinpoints some of the
   problems that companies involved with collaborative product platform
   development, together with their suppliers, must face today. To answer
   these questions, interviews, and document studies were conducted for a
   Swedish truck manufacturer. The results are oriented to the interfaces
   between product owners and their suppliers.

AB To meet the increasingly heterogeneous market, a product family
   strategy is needed to determine how customized variants can be derived
   from a common product platform within acceptable cost and time. Toward
   this, a suitably conceived and developed product family architecture
   (PFA) is important for implementing mass customization. In this paper,
   we present a systematic approach to modularize PFA at the early design
   phase, which is the conceptual design stage. The PFA can be viewed as a
   conceptual structure with the following three interrelated elements:
   module, variant, and coupling interface. Identifying variant as the
   external driver of architectural variation, this paper develops a
   variety index (VI) method to estimate effects of customization on the
   conceptual modules. Rather than just identification of module boundary
   in the product architecture, the proposed modularization method
   translates the variety source generated from requirements analysis into
   a dynamic configuration of the conceptual PFA, involving variety
   analysis, product modularization, and generation of product portfolio
   architecture. An example of a power tool design is used to demonstrate
   the proposed method.

AB As the marketplace has been changing so rapidly, it has been a key
   issue for companies to best meet customers' diverse demands by
   providing a variety of products in a cost-effective and timely manner.
   In the meantime, an increasing variety of capability and functionality
   of products has made it more difficult for companies that develop only
   one product at a time to maintain competitive production cost and
   reclaim market share. By designing a product family based on a robust
   product platform, overall production cost can be more competitive than
   competitors selling one product at a time while delivering highly
   differentiated products. In order to design cost-effective product
   families and product platforms, a production cost estimation framework
   was presented in order that relevant costs are collected, estimated,
   and analysed. Since the framework is quite broad, this paper is
   dedicated to refining the estimation framework in a practical way by
   developing an activity-based costing (ABC) system in which activity
   costs are mapped to individual parts in the product family, which is
   called cost modularization, and the activity costs affected by product
   family design decisions are restructured to make the costs relevant to
   these decisions. A case study involving a family of power tools is used
   to demonstrate the proposed use of the ABC system.

AB The architecture improvement method (AIM) is a method for
   multidisciplinary product architecture improvement, addressing
   uncertainty and complexity and incorporating feedback loops,
   facilitating trade-off decision making during the architecture creation
   process. The research reported in this paper demonstrates the ability
   of the AIM to contribute to cost management and systemic learning in
   the creation of strategic product architectures, throughout the entire
   product life cycle. Application of the method in five case studies
   within two divisions of Royal Philips Electronics shows that in cases
   of medium uncertainty, substantial cost management benefits can be
   achieved and that the AIM facilitates systemic learning through the
   accumulation of architectural competence, thus facilitating
   organizational memory.

AB An adaptive product platform offers high customizability for generating
   feasible product variants for customer requirements. Customization
   takes place not only to product platform structure but also to its
   relevant parameters. Structural and parametric optimization processes
   are interwoven with each other to achieve the total optimality. This
   paper presents an evolutionary method dealing with interwoven
   structural and parametric optimization of adaptive platform product
   customization. The method combines genetic programming and genetic
   algorithm for handling structural and parametric optimization,
   respectively. Efficient genetic representation and operation schemes
   are carefully adapted. While designing these schemes, features specific
   to structural and parameter customization are considered for the
   simplification of platform product management. The experimental results
   show that the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms that of
   the tandem evolutionary algorithm in which a genetic algorithm for
   parametric optimization is totally nested in a genetic programming for
   structural optimization. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Product design engineering is undergoing a transformation from informal
   and largely experience-based discipline to a science-based domain.
   Computational intelligence (CI) offers models and algorithms that can
   contribute greatly to design formalization and automation. This paper
   surveys CI concepts and approaches applicable to product design
   engineering. Taxonomy of the surveyed literature is presented according
   to the generally recognized areas in both product design engineering
   and CI. Some research issues that arise from the broad perspective
   presented in the paper have been signaled but not fully pursued. No
   survey of such a broad field can be complete; however, the material
   presented in the paper is a summary of state-of-the-art CI concepts and
   approaches in product design engineering.

AB Product family design and platform-based product development has
   received much attention over the last decade. This paper provides a
   comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research in this field. A
   decision framework is introduced to reveal a holistic view of product
   family design and platform-based product development, encompassing both
   front-end and back-end issues. The review is organized according to
   various topics in relation to product families, including fundamental
   issues and definitions, product portfolio and product family
   positioning, platform-based product family design, manufacturing and
   production, as well as supply chain management. Major challenges and
   future research directions are also discussed.

TI An active styling platform for designing and developing product families
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING

DT Article
DE product styling platform; active style diagnosis; diffusion styles;
   mass customisation
ID CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS; EXPERTISE; FRAMEWORK
AB In recent years, fierce market competition has increased the need for
   incorporating manufacturing flexibility into product styling. The
   product styling platform approach proposed in this paper offers an
   insight into how this challenge can be dealt with by transforming an
   existing product fashion into an intangible styling module with the
   view to refreshing its appeal. This paper addresses the important
   issues of how the approach can be turned into a robust applicational
   tool to facilitate the design of product families to satisfy diverse
   customer needs. The paper investigates the nature and quantification of
   modular styling. By capturing and analysing design experts' opinions on
   product styling, the evolution of a fashion can be quantified in the
   form of a schema of diffusion styles. The study has also led to the
   development of the ideas of "Prompt Time Market Segmentation Grid" and
   the "Active Style Diagnosis". The concepts are applied in an "Active
   Product Styling Platform" with scalable and expandable capabilities to
   enhance the effectiveness of conventional product styling practices.
   This approach can also help the formation of product style families and
   facilitate the development of products particularly in a mass
   customisation environment.

AB The assemble-to-order (ATO) production strategy considers a tradeoff
   between the size of a product portfolio and the assembly lead time. The
   concept of modular design is often used in support of the ATO strategy.
   Modular design impacts the assembly of products and the supply chain,
   in particular, the storage, transport, and production are affected by
   the selected modular structure. The demand for products in a product
   family impacts the cost of the supply chain. Based on the demand
   patterns, a mix of modules and their stock are determined by solving an
   integer programming model. This model cannot be optimally solved due to
   its high computational complexity and, therefore, two heuristic
   algorithms are proposed. A simulated annealing algorithm improves on
   the previously generated solutions. The computational results reported
   in this paper show that significant savings could be realized by
   optimizing the composition of modules. The best performance is obtained
   by a simulated annealing combined with a heuristic approach.
   Note to Practitioners-In today's markets, companies tend to compete
   with product costs and delivery times. Mass customization principles
   have emerged as ways of gaining competitiveness. To individualize
   offerings of products, some companies manage options and alternatives
   around the same product category. Large product portfolios allow
   customers to select products closely matching their needs, however, it
   usually implies a larger cost to the producer. The importance of demand
   for final products when allocating assembly operations in a supply
   chain is emphasized. The research reported in this paper demonstrates
   that for the same level of anticipated product demand, the level and
   mix of stock impact the customer delivery time. The latter implies that
   the same degree of customer satisfaction could be realized with
   different anticipated stock levels and costs. An assemble-to-order
   (ATO) case study is presented. The ATO production strategy considers a
   tradeoff between the size of a product portfolio and the assembly lead
   time. The concept of modular design is often used in support of the ATO
   strategy. Modular design impacts the assembly of products and the
   supply chain, in particular, the storage, transport, and production are
   affected by the selected modular structure.

TI A tandem evolutionary algorithm for platform product customization
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN; ARCHITECTURE; OPTIMIZATION
AB The increasing demand for reduction in time to market has led to new
   product development methodologies focusing on reuse. Platform product
   customization emerges as a basic idea for avoiding designing a new
   product completely from scratch, but reusing a product platform instead
   Key dimensions of some modules of the platform can be stretched or
   shrunk while modules themselves can be swapped to formulate multiple
   product variants in a family according to specific customer
   requirements. This paper formulates such a problem of platform product
   customization as an optimization problem consistent, with the
   manufacturer's goal in the design of product variant(s) while
   satisfying customer requirements and design constraints. Optimal
   customization takes place at the levels of product structure and module
   parameters. A tandem evolutionary algorithm is proposed for identifying
   the optimal structural composition and the optimal parameters of the
   corresponding structure. The encoding schemes and genetic operators for
   structure and parameter optimization are designed, respectively. A case
   study of gantry crane customization is given to illustrate how the
   proposed evolutionary customization design method is used. The

AB Research on modularity and commonality has grown substantially over the
   past 15 years. Searching 36 journals over more than the past 35 years,
   over 160 references are identified in the engineering and management
   literature that focus on modularity or commonality in the product and
   process development context. Each of the references is analyzed along
   the dimensions subject, effect, and research method. The subjects of
   these studies have been products, processes, organizations, and even
   innovations, although the set of references shows a strong preference
   towards products. Similarly, a broad range of effects has been studied,
   albeit with the topic cost dominating all other effects. A variety of
   research methods has been applied to the study of modularity and
   commonality but the distribution of research methods differs
   substantially for modularity and commonality research. Despite the
   wealth of existing research, there are still significant opportunities
   for future research. In particular, studies that incorporate modularity
   and commonality's multiple effects on various players along the supply
   chain, that combine multiple research methods, and that follow systems
   over time appear very promising.

AB Engineering design reuse refers to the utilization of any knowledge
   gained from the design activity to support future design. As such,
   engineering design reuse approaches are concerned with the support,
   exploration, and enhancement of design knowledge prior, during, and
   after a design activity. Modular design is a product structuring
   principle whereby products are developed with distinct modules for
   rapid product development, efficient upgrades, and possible reuse (of
   the physical modules). The benefits of modular design center on a
   greater capacity for structuring component parts to better manage the
   relation between market requirements and the designed product. This
   study explores the capabilities of modular design principles to provide
   improved support for the engineering design reuse concept. The
   correlations between modular design and 'reuse' are highlighted, with
   the aim of identifying its potential to aid the little-supported
   process of design for reuse. In fulfilment of this objective the
   authors not only identify the requirements of design for reuse, but
   also propose how modular design principles can be extended to support
   design for reuse.

AB Product modularity has been discussed in engineering and management
   literature for over forty years. During this time span, definitions and
   views on the meaning of product modularity proliferated to the extent
   that it is difficult to understand the essential traits of the concept.
   While definitional ambiguity is often a byproduct of academic debate,
   it hinders the advancement of scientific knowledge as well. This paper
   aims to move a step forward toward a more precise definition of product
   modularity, by articulating a product system modularity construct in
   the domain of tangible, assembled artifacts. More precisely, the paper
   constitutively defines product modularity in terms of component
   separability and component combinability. An indirect operational
   definition for product modularity is then proposed by operationalizing
   component separability and component combinability. The proposed
   definition is finally related to other definitional perspectives
   synthesized by a literature review: component commonality, function
   binding, interface standardization, and loose coupling. In this way,
   the nomological network of the product modularity construct is laid
   out. Construct validation activities are left to further research.

AB With the growing competition in businesses, satisfying customers'
   individual requirements has turned into a competitive edge. Highly
   diversified customer needs lead to not only high product variety but
   also the associated cost implications. In order to handle the
   complexity and intertwining relationships of variety and cost, a
   systematic approach is proposed based on product and process modeling.
   This approach includes two phases: phase I models product and process
   variety and studies their relationships; and phase II investigates the
   relationships between product variety and costs and identifies major
   additional cost contributors, namely variety cost drivers in the
   product family design. A case study is presented to demonstrate the
   feasibility and potential of the proposed approach.

AB Product customization has been recognized as an effective means to meet
   individual customers' needs. It is imperative to assist customers in
   making informed decisions with regard to company capabilities and the
   added value of customization. Customer value analysis not only empowers
   customers to express their preferences for various product features
   explicitly, but it also facilitates the company's justification of
   different customization solutions. This paper analyzes diverse elements
   of product quality in relation to customization and introduces utility
   functions to quantify the customer-perceived value in terms of the
   quality utility per unit cost and the ratio of marginal utility to
   marginal cost. Adaptive conjoint analysis is employed to capture the
   utility function of product quality with respect to many specific
   product features. With quantitative analysis of quality utility,
   customers can be actively involved in the product customization
   process. Product marketing and design engineering are coordinated
   through the product family architecture, enabling the convergence of
   customers' needs to product offerings of the company. Also reported is
   a case study of customizing power supply design for a
   telecommunications system.

AB Informality of design requirements is a problem, especially in
   distributed design teams, because it impacts upon the ability of a team
   to communicate. Since design requirements drive the design process,
   their miscommunication results in serious problems; for example, new
   products that do not align with the needs of the range of stakeholders
   to whom they are targeted. This, in turn, has a detrimental impact on
   traditional business performance indicators, such as market share,
   volume of sales, and profit. The research reported in this paper
   explored the applicability of requirements engineering and management
   techniques, traditionally used in the development of software-intensive
   systems, to the development of electromechanical consumer products. The
   motivational rationale traceability matrix (MoRaI(TM)) is introduced as
   a means to support the initial analysis of stakeholder needs and
   attributes, and the derivation of corresponding design requirements.
   The applicability of MoRal(TM) is demonstrated through application to a
   power solution case study. In this instance, the MoRal(TM) proved to be
   a powerful means of supporting the derivation of design requirements
   that are aligned with customer and other stakeholder needs, and are
   traceable to stakeholder intents.

AB Recent market transition from mass production to mass customization
   forces manufacturers to develop product families with a common platform
   to increase design variety, shorten time-to-market, and reduce
   production costs. This paper presents a new functional modeling
   approach to support identification of both shared and individual
   behavioral modules across a family of products for module-based product
   family design. After separate functional modeling of each product
   variant, the individual functional models are merged into a single,
   coherent, and unified family functional model to determine all the
   shared and individual behavioral modules. The modularity in the family
   functional model is further explicitly identified using a behavioral
   modularity matrix of product variants versus behavior. The proposed
   approach provides a fast method for generating new concept variants
   during the conceptual design of a family of products. The rationale of
   managing modularity in product family design with functional modeling
   is manifested using a modular design example of a family of automatic
   assembly devices.

AB With a view to reducing the distance between company and consumer, an
   enterprise should be able to offer enough differentiation in products
   to meet the consumer's needs and requirements regarding production
   process and cost. This is referred to as a 'mass customization
   production environment'. In such an environment, the variety of product
   configurations causes many problems pertaining to information
   processing and management. In this study, the authors attempted to
   propose a binary-tree-based algorithm to coordinate the sale and R&D
   departments. Based upon the binary tree concept, the system not only
   offers the data structure and graph representation for product
   information, but also searches for feasible configuration solutions
   that meet the customer's needs. Furthermore, a profit analysis is
   proposed to serve as a criterion for marketing staff's strategy. A
   screwdriver and a PC are used as practical examples to illustrate the
   application of the binary-tree-based algorithm in this study. Finally,
   the C++ programming language is used to simulate and verify the
   proposed method.

AB Product configuration design is of critical importance in design for
   mass customization. This paper will investigate two important issues in
   configuration design. The first issue is requirement configuration and
   a dependency analysis approach is proposed and implemented to link
   customer groups with clusters of product specifications. The second
   issue concerns the engineering configuration and it is modelled as an
   association relation between clusters of product specifications and
   configuration alternatives. A novel methodology and architecture are
   proposed for accomplishing the two configuration tasks and bridging the
   gap between them. This methodology is based on integration of popular
   data mining approaches (such as fuzzy clustering and association rule
   mining) and variable precision rough set. It focuses on the discovery
   of configuration rules from the purchased products according to
   customer groups. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case
   study of an electrical bicycle.

ID TREES
AB Data mining has been making inroads into the engineering design
   environment-an area that generates large amounts of heterogeneous data
   for which suitable mining methods are not readily available. For
   instance, an unsupervised data mining task (clustering) requires an
   accurate measure of distance or similarity. This paper focuses on the
   development of an accurate similarity measure for bills of materials
   (BOM) that can be used to cluster BOMs into product families and
   subfamilies. The paper presents a new problem called tree bundle
   matching (TBM) that is identified as a result of the research, gives a
   non-polynomial formulation, a proof that the problem is NP-hard, and
   suggests possible heuristic approaches.
   In a typical life cycle of an engineering project or product, enormous
   amounts of diverse engineering data are generated. Some of these
   include BOM, product design models in CAD, engineering drawings,
   manufacturing process plans, quality and test data, and warranty
   records. Such data contain information crucial for efficient and timely
   development of new products and variants; however, this information is
   often not available to designers. Our research employs data mining
   methods to extract this design information and improve its
   accessibility to design engineers. This paper focuses on one aspect of
   the overall research agenda, clustering BOMs into families and
   subfamilies. It extends previous work on a graph-based similarity
   measure for BOMs (a class of unordered trees) by presenting a new TBM
   problem, and proves the problem to be NP-hard. The overall contribution
   of this work is to demonstrate the OR applications from graph matching,
   stochastic methods, optimization, and others to data mining in the
   engineering design environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

ID CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS
AB In mass customization, web-centric knowledge-based configuration
   systems have become an important tool to help customers configure
   products that satisfy their different needs and the complex
   configuration constraints of a product family (PF). An effective
   knowledge representation scheme and the associated reasoning mechanisms
   are essential for the success of these systems. This paper presents an
   object-oriented approach that integrates the functional and structural
   models of a PF with design process knowledge. Invasion-based search
   algorithms are proposed to deal with different situations in product
   customization and heuristic knowledge is introduced in these algorithms
   to improve the search efficiency. Optimization models have been
   constructed in terms of customers' preferences to provide them with the
   highest satisfaction in product customization. Based on the
   representation scheme and reasoning algorithms, a web-based
   configuration system prototype is developed to support product
   customization. An example of a bicycle family is used as a study case
   and described in details.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS

DE mass customization; competitive priority; modularity; metrics
ID METHODOLOGY
AB Mass customization as a competitive strategy is getting progressively
   increasing attention in business and academic arenas due to its high
   potential to provide sustained strategic advantage in a unique fashion.
   It is well documented that a manufacturing company competes with others
   in its industry on five dimensions: Price, quality, flexibility,
   delivery, and service. According to the existing literature, mass
   customization provides significant strategic advantage in two of these
   dimensions-price and customization. We, however, argue that when
   properly implemented, the cellular manufacturing structure associated
   with the appropriate implementation of mass customization strategy,
   provides additional competitive value in quality and delivery.
   Furthermore by virtue of the customer co-design as an integral aspect
   of mass customization, customer satisfaction also improves under this
   strategy. Mass customization strategy, therefore, provides competitive
   advantage in all five competitive dimensions simultaneously-a truly
   unique strategic accomplishment. We also propose, in this paper, new
   metrics for mass customization strategy that measure the "mass" as well
   as the "customization" aspects of this strategy. Finally, we describe
   in the clearest terms the modus operandi of modularity in product
   design and the role it plays in bringing about high levels of
   customization on one hand and economies of scale at component level, on
   the other. We conclude with remarks that underscore the need for
   conducting research in the areas at the interface of mass customization
   and supply chain management.

AB An increasing trend towards a new manufacturing paradigm of 'instant
   customerisation' is occurring due to customers demanding their orders
   for customised products or services be fulfilled under zero customer
   lead time and at a price near the price of mass production. By means of
   the manufacturing paradigm innovation model (MPIM), the operational
   tactics, operational tenets, and an operational framework of instant
   customerisation are elicited and described. An important new tactic
   within all the operational tactics is finalise-to-individual demand
   forecasting, meaning end products are finalised according to the
   forecasting of individual customer's needs. The knowledge and
   information, which is the primary input of individual demand
   forecasting, is gleaned and understood by total customer participation
   and value fusion. Total customer participation and value fusion are
   developed through customer participation and customer relationship
   management, which have critical distinctions. The operational
   framework, which is termed manufacturing paradigm tree of instant
   customerisation, can characterise the operational tenets, the
   relationships between different operational tactics and the objectives,
   and the relationships among different operational tactics. With the
   proposed framework, instant customerisation can be understood more
   effectively and holistically.

AB After the industrial revolution, the literature has mentioned different
   "principles" to allow a better management of the production and product
   life cycle activities. For example the principle of standardization was
   first mentioned in the literature by an automobile engineer and placed
   in a real context by Henry Ford. Standardization has made possible the
   configuration of different products using a large set of common
   components. Another strategy called "modularization" was first
   mentioned in the literature in the 60s. The modularity proposed to
   group components of products in a module for practical production
   objectives. Today, modularity and standardization are promising tools
   in product family development because they allow to design a variety of
   products using the same modules of components called "platforms". Using
   platforms allows important family design savings and easy
   manufacturing. In this paper we give a literature review of the
   platform concept with a special interest on the efficient product
   family development. This paper is organized as follows. Section 1
   mentions the general context of modularity to develop product variety.
   Section 2 details the importance of product architectures in the
   literature for a modular design. Section 3 points on some important
   works that apply some modular and platform methodologies.

AB Product customization systems are important for enterprises to bring
   out innovative and profitable products to the market quickly. The
   current systems for product customization allow customers to specify
   their requirements by selecting and configuring products. Customers'
   individual requirements beyond product configuration cannot be
   fulfilled in these systems. The integration among the product
   customization system and other application systems of the enterprise is
   seldom considered. This paper proposes an internet-based product
   customization system for CIM. The system enables enterprises to meet
   with customers' individual requirements more effectively by providing
   more customization approaches. Through system integration for CIM, the
   system eases enterprises to optimize their product development
   processes and supply chains according to customers' requirements in a
   systematic way. System structure and function model are presented in
   this paper. Working mechanism for the system is proposed. Key
   technologies for system implementation including customer requirements
   description and system integration are also discussed in detail in the
   paper. Finally, an internet-based customization system for ceramics
   products is developed as a case study. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB In variant design, the proliferation of bills of materials makes it
   difficult for designers to find previous designs that would aid in
   completing a new design task. This research presents a novel, data
   mining approach to forming generic bills of materials (GBOMs), entities
   that represent the different variants in a product family and
   facilitate the search for similar designs and configuration of new
   variants. The technical difficulties include: (i) developing families
   or categories for products, assemblies, and component parts; (ii)
   generalizing purchased parts and quantifying their similarity; (iii)
   performing tree union; and (iv) establishing design constraints. These
   challenges are met through data mining methods such as text and tree
   mining, a new tree union procedure, and embodying the GBOM and design
   constraints in constrained XML. The paper concludes with a case study;
   using data from a manufacturer of nurse call devices, and identifies a
   new research direction for data mining motivated by the domains of
   engineering design and information.

TI Complex assembly variant design in agile manufacturing. Part 1: System
   architecture and assembly modeling methodology
SO IIE TRANSACTIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRESENTATION; GENERATION
AB In the distributed and horizontally integrated manufacturing
   environment found in agile manufacturing, there is a great demand for
   new product development methods that are capable of generating new
   customized assembly designs based on mature component designs that
   might be dispersed at geographically distributed partner sites. To
   cater for this demand, this paper addresses the methodology for complex
   assembly variant design in agile manufacturing. It consists in
   fundamental research in two parts: (i) assembly modeling; and (ii)
   assembly variant design methodology. This paper, the first of a
   two-part series, presents the assembly variant design system
   architecture and the assembly modeling methodology. First, a
   complementary assembly modeling concept is proposed with two kinds of
   assembly models, the hierarchical assembly model and the relational
   assembly model. The first explicitly captures the hierarchical and
   functional relationships between constituent components whereas the
   second explicitly captures the mating relationships at the
   form-feature-level. These models are complementary in the sense that
   each of them models only a specific aspect of assembly-related
   information but together they include the required assembly-related
   information. They are further specialized to accommodate the features
   of assembly variant design. As a result, two kinds of assembly models,
   the assembly variants model and the assembly mating graph are
   generated. These assembly models serve as the basis for assembly
   variant design which is discussed in the companion paper.

AB It has been well recognized that product portfolio planning has
   far-reaching impact on the company's business success in competition.
   In general, product portfolio planning involves two main stages, namely
   portfolio identification and portfolio evaluation and selection. The
   former aims to capture and understand customer needs effectively and
   accordingly to transform them into specifications of product offerings.
   The latter concerns how to determine an optimal configuration of these
   identified offerings with the objective of achieving best profit
   performance. Current research and industrial practice have mainly
   focused on the economic justification of a given product portfolio,
   whereas the portfolio identification issue has been received only
   limited attention. This article intends to develop explicit decision
   support to improve product portfolio identification by efficient
   knowledge discovery,from past sales and product records. As one of the
   important applications of data mining, association rule mining lends
   itself to the discovery of useful patterns associated with requirement
   analysis enacted among customers, marketing folks, and designers. An
   association rule mining system (ARMS) is proposed for effective product
   portfolio identification. Based on a scrutiny into the product
   definition process, the article studies the fundamental issues
   underlying product portfolio identification. The ARMS differentiates
   the customer needs from functional requirements involved in the
   respective customer and functional domains. Product portfolio
   identification entails the identification of functional requirement
   clusters in conjunction with the mappings from customer needs to these
   clusters. While clusters of functional requirements are identified
   based on fuzzy clustering analysis, the mapping mechanism between the
   customer and functional domains is incarnated in association rules. The
   ARMS architecture and implementation issues are discussed in detail. An
   application of the proposed methodology and system in a consumer
   electronics company to generate a vibration motor portfolio for mobile
   phones is also presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents a model and an algorithm for selection of
   subassemblies based on the analysis of prior orders received from the
   customers. The parameters of this model are generated using association
   rules extracted by a data mining algorithm. The extracted knowledge is
   applied to construct a model for selection of subassemblies for timely
   delivery from the suppliers to the contractor. The proposed knowledge
   discovery and optimization framework integrates the concepts from
   product design and manufacturing efficiency. The ideas introduced in
   the paper are illustrated with an example and an automotive case study.

ID MODULAR PRODUCTS; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE
AB This paper comprehensively studies assembly process design (APD) to
   handle variety and presents a new approach to strategically manage
   manufacturing complexities because of product varieties. It links the
   chronological steps of APD to a general approach with a view to reduce
   both short and long term wastes. It synthesizes two strategic
   approaches, product and process-based, while exploiting the APD of an
   entire product family. A new evaluation method for measuring the
   complexities of an assembly system at different stages of design has
   been introduced by applying information entropy. The developed
   evaluation methodology explains the available techniques related to
   design, interprets them from a design for variety point of view, and
   leads to techniques to manage complexities in manufacturing. The
   suggested methodology has been applied to examples from automobile part
   manufacturers and has been found to be effective in understanding the
   complexities in manufacturing and leading to some strategies to manage
   variety.

AB Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMSs) offer a key technology for
   the realization of mass customization. Compared with integral systems,
   RMS may provide system configurations to satisfy a wide range of
   Functional Requirements (FRs). An important issue for RMS is
   configuration design, the determination of a configuration from all of
   feasible configurations to meet FRs. Configuration design of strongly
   coupled RMS, such as reconfigurable robotic system, has particular
   challenges due to special characteristics compared with dedicated
   systems. In this research, a methodology for the design of
   Reconfigurable Robotic Systems (RRSs) is described. The proposed
   methodology can be generalized to other reconfigurable manufacturing
   systems having similar features.

AB Product customization has been recognized as an effective means to
   implement mass customization. This paper focuses on the customizability
   issue of design, that is, to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a
   design to be customized in order to meet individual customer needs.
   Three aspects of customizability are identified, namely, (1) design
   customizability: the intrinsic nature of product by design, which
   renders customization to be easy or deficient for either customers or
   the manufacturer, (2) process customizability: the economic latitude of
   (production) process variations due to product customization, and (3)
   the value of customization as perceived by the customers. While design
   customizability is measured based on the information content metric,
   the evaluation of process customizability follows the general gist of
   process capability indices. Conjoint analysis is employed to explore
   customer preference for multiple product features in terms of utility.
   Customizability analysis thus exhibits a maximization of
   customer-perceived value while exploiting the potential of design to be
   customized by achieving optimal design and process customizability
   indices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research in operations management suggests that firms can mitigate the
   negative impact of product variety on operational performance by
   deliberately pursuing modularity in the design of product family
   architectures. However, modularity is not a dichotomous property of a
   product, as different types of modularity can be embedded into a
   product family architecture. The present paper explores how
   manufacturing characteristics affect the appropriate type of modularity
   to be embedded into the product family architecture, and how the types
   of modularity relate to component sourcing. The study is based on a
   qualitative research design involving a multiple case study methodology
   to examine six product families belonging to six European companies.
   The themes derived through case analyses are synthesized in the form of
   empirical generalizations. Insights from these empirical
   generalizations are subsequently developed into two propositions
   explaining why and under what conditions these empirical
   generalizations might hold for a product family outside of the original
   sample. The theoretical results formalize, first of all, a type of
   modularity (i.e. combinatorial modularity) not currently described in
   literature. Second, the theoretical propositions suggest that when the
   desired level of product variety is low (high) relative to total
   production volume, component swapping modularity (combinatorial
   modularity) helps to maximize operational performance. Finally, the
   complexity of component families outsourced to suppliers and the
   geographical proximity of component family suppliers affect the extent
   to which the product variety-operational performance trade-off can be
   mitigated through modularity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB The idea of modularity has gained acceptance because of so-called mass
   customisation. and the need for shorter development time in
   manufacturing. Modularity is a general concept, and many engineering
   problems can be generalised under the umbrella of modularity. Numerous
   studies have been carried out on modularity-relevant issues, however,
   systematic classification has not been discussed for modularity in
   terms of its applications and methodologies for developing modularity
   in systems. This paper presents a taxonomy on modularity applications,
   research issues, and design methodologies. It provides a general
   framework for further systematic development of modularity in systems.
   General solutions to identified problems which should be studied in
   future are also discussed.

AB Remote manufacturing allows companies to dynamically establish
   manufacturing alliances by exploiting advantages of enabling
   information technologies. Product data management and information
   integration are two of the most important issues for success of remote
   manufacturing. In this paper, we studied the two issues by taking a
   case of a remote manufacturing implementation in a robot manufacturing
   company. An integrated product data model and the related configuration
   management methods are developed. Under a hybrid architecture of Web
   browser/server and client/server, an application system is presented to
   manipulate the product data and to carry out a variety of manufacturing
   functions. Finally, a CORBA standards-based integration framework is
   proposed to achieve interoperability among multiple data and
   application objects over the Internet and company Intranets. (C) 2001

AB Modular products, which capitalize on the concept of mass
   customization, are concerned with the creation of product variants
   without incurring the excessive cost that seems to be inevitable in the
   mass production approach. To implement modular product design
   effectively, it is essential that a certain level of decision support
   functionality is provided during the product development stages. The
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which breaks down a complex problem
   into simple hierarchical decision-making processes, can be incorporated
   with fuzzy logic to suggest the relative strength of the factors in the
   corresponding criteria, thereby enabling the construction of a fuzzy
   judgement matrix to facilitate decision-making. This paper proposes a
   fuzzy AHP approach in modular product design complemented with a case
   example to validate its feasibility in a real company. Test findings
   indicate that the approach is helpful for providing key decision
   support information in terms of product module selection during product
   development stages. The significance of the contribution of this paper
   is the suggestion of a novel approach in modular product design,
   embracing a combination of computational intelligence and traditional
   techniques, thereby providing more alternatives and ideas for those
   researchers who are interested in this field of study.
