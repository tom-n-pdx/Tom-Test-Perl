abstract={Time-series analysis in Econometrics provides advanced methods
identifying relationship among time-seriesed subjects which have been
rarely applied to engineering management field. While sophisticated
econometrics methods such as distributed lag model with unrestricted
lag, arithmetic lag, polynomial lag and geometric lag structure, and
dynamics model theories enrich analysis of economic data consisting of
long time periods and their lasting effect, observations in the
engineering management field which tends to have highly uncertain time
effect and relatively insufficient time-series hinder applying and
benefiting from time lag analysis which is very important to understand
dynamic behavior of subject in this field. Therefore, this study
revisits and compares selected time series approaches using simulated
data set representing university technology licensing and suggest a
process for detecting time-lag coefficients of licensing input and
output variables.},
