Notes Modern Perl

Great book on writing maintainable Perl.

Reread Chapter 8 - end after using perl for 3 months.


* ToDo


* Chapter 1

  + Contxt is imporant - what func returns depends on what context is used.
  	+ Void: 	find_chores();
	+ Scalar	my $single_result = find_chores();
	+ List	my @all_results = find_chores();
			my ($single_element, @rest) = find_chores();
			my ($single_element) = find_chores();   				- careful -
  	list contect - one value

	Also for values
	     my $numeric_x = 0 + $x; 	# forces numeric context 
	     my $stringy_x = '' . $x; 	# forces string context
 	     my $boolean_x = !!$x;	# forces boolean context
  



* Chapter 2 - Community 
  + Good tutorial configure cpan download http://learnperl.scratchcomputing.com/tutorials/configuration/
  

* Chapter 3 - The Perl Language
  + Names  -start _ or letter - contain letter, number, _
  + Package Names: Style  -should start with upprcase - only core modules lower case
  + Lexical scope for values
    + Scope within brackets
    + Scope within a file
    + A package with no { }- scope is entire file
    + A loope variable declared in for statment doesn't exist outside loop. If want to know value of last
      loop must use a my & declare it before loop starts.
  + Perl Supports Unicode
    + Always decode to/from from the appropriate encoding at the inputs and outputs of your program
    + Open with Unicode encoding
        open my $fh, '<:utf8', $textfile; 
        my $unicode_string = <$fh>;
    + To write program using unicode in source
      	use utf8;
  + Undef is what declared but undefined scalars contain undef
    + A empty list () - in scalar context is a undef
    + Will get count of list items as scalar without a temp var
      my $count = () = get_clown_hats();
  + if / unless - as postfix & bracket versions
  + for has post fix version - for 1..5
    + !! For loop aliases the iteration value. So - if modifie the iteration value - it changes the original value.
  + while loop
    + Does NOT alias the changes to the values
    + Executes as long as expression true
    + If need to - change looping condation within loop
  + do
    + Executes a block of code - once (unlike while or until)
    + can use postfix while or until to get an initial execution
  + Loop Control
    + next - restarts loop at next iteration
    + last - ends the loop
    + redo  - restarts loop without re-evaluate conditional
    + continue block - executes at end of loop iteration before next iteration starts
      + Not executed after a last or redo
  + No good switch statment
    + Use for & when
  + tailcall
    + If last thing in sub is return calling a sub and returning it's value - a lot more effecient
  + Arrays
    + Length of array - access in scalar context - but last element index is length - 1
    + $#array  -is last index of arrary
    + -1 is index to last element of array
    + assign to $#array to CHANGE size of array
    + If pass multiple arrays to function - get flattened to one
  + push / pop
    + add to end of array
    + can push 1 or list of items - returns the # elements in array
    + pop can only remove one, return value is what was removed
  + shift / unshift
    + same as pop - to front of array
  + splice can implement all of the pop, push, shift, unshift versions
  + each - can iterate over array with both index & value
    	while (my ($position, $title) = each @bookshelf) { 
  	  say "#$position: $title";
  	}
  + arrays interpolate into strings using the global $" operator. To help debug can localize it and change it
    	local $" = ')(';
  	say "(@sweet_treats)";
  + hash
    + exists - is a key present
    + key may exist and be undef - use exists && defined
    + Can iterate
      + keys - by each key
      + values - list of hash values
      + each - key & value
	+ Only one itterator per hash
	+ Do not start a new iterator - old one will end
    + Hash slice
      	my @buyer_addresses = @addresses{ @buyers };
  + A var can have two values - numeric & string
    	use Scalar::Util 'dualvar';
  	my $false_name = dualvar 0, 'Sparkles & Blue';
  + Package has a few implicit values
    	our $VERSION - or put a format like v1.2.1 in package line
  + Reference
    + Scalars
  	Pass by reference
  	\$var = $value - ref to variable
  	$$var - deference var
  	${ $var}} is same thing - sometimes clearer  -sometimes less
  	@_ is a alias of values, so can modify them in place
	    Make a copy of values in sub - don't surprise anybody
    + Arrays
      my $cards_ref = \@cards;				Reference
      my $card_count = @$cards_ref; 			Dereference into scalar
      my @card_copy = @$cards_ref;			Dereference into list
      my $first_card = $cards_ref->[0];			Dereference an individual element - use ->
      my $first_card = $$cards_ref[0];			An alternative - maybe less clear
      my @high_cards = @{ $cards_ref }[0 .. 2, -1];	Dereference a slice
      my $suits_ref = [qw( Monkeys Robots Cheese )];    Brackets create ref to ananmouse array

    + Hash
      my $colors_ref = \%colors;			Hash Red
      my @english_colors = keys %$colors_ref; 		Dereference hash
      my @spanish_colors = values %$colors_ref;
      return $colors_ref->{$color};			Use -> for individual values
      
      my @colors = qw( red blue green );		Slice a hash
      my @colores = @{ $colors_ref }{@colors};

      my $food_ref = {					Anonymous hash
  	'birthday cake' => 'la torta de cumpleantildeos',
      }

      Assigning an anonymous hash to a standard hash produces a warning about an odd number of elements in the
      hash. Use parentheses for a named hash and curly brackets for an anonymous hash.

    + Function
      Functions are first class data type.

      sub bake_cake { say 'Baking a wonderful cake!' }; Reference to function
      my $cake_ref = \&bake_cake;			Without & sigil would be reference to return values

      my $pie_ref = sub { say 'Making a pie!' };	Ref to anonymous function

      $pie_ref->();					Executes the function

    + Can take ref to filehandle
    + Nested Data structure
      + Arrary of arrays
	my @famous_triplets = ( \@counts, \@ducks, \@game);
      
        my @famous_triplets = (				Ananamous version
  		[qw( eenie miney moe )], 
  		[qw( huey dewey louie )],
  		[qw( duck duck goose )],
  	);

	my $nephew = $famous_triplets[1]->[2];		Refrence into nested datastruture
  	my $side = $meals{breakfast}->{side};

	my $nephew = $famous_triplets[1][2]; 		Must use Ref - so can skip arrow
  	my $meal = $meals{breakfast}{side};

	my ($entree, $side) 				Slice a nested datastructure
  		= @{ $meals{breakfast} }{ qw( entree side ) };
	
	($entree, $side) 				Or use for - not no my
  		= @{ $_ }{qw( entree side )} for $meals{breakfast};
	
	Read perldoc perldsc

	If write to non-exisitent element nested datastructure - perl will create the whole path to it. This
        is autovivification.

	Problem is - perl can't tell difference between creating a new element and a mistake.

	autovivification pragma allows you to disable after code in production.
		

* Chapter 4 - Operators
  + defined-or operator, //, tests the definedness of its operand
    // evaluates to a true value even if its operand evaluates to a numeric zero or the empty string
    my $name = shift // 'Fluffy';
  + auto-increment operator has special behavior
    ++ is magic on a clearly string value
  + infix range operator (..)
    my @cards = ( 2 .. 10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A' );	List context - produces list of items
    
    In boolean context, the range operator performs a flip-flop operation
    

* Chapter 5 - Functions
  + Paramaters passed in @_
    array built in's use @_ as default within a sub
  + Function signatures added in Perl 5.20 but experimental
    use experimental 'signatures';			To enable
    
    sub greet_one($name) { 				Takes only ONE arg and assigns it to $home
  	say "Hello, $name!";
    }	

    sub greet_one($name = 'Bruce') { 			If has default - is optional paramater
  	say "Hello, $name!";
    }

    Lots more options - see perldoc perlsub Signatures section

  + subs flatten the args durring the call. Scalar args must come first.

  + remember - @_ aliases the paramaters
    Changing the @_ value changes the orginal

  + use caller to help report errors
    my ($package, $file, $line) = caller(); 
    say "Called from $package in $file:$line";

  + Use caller (or Carp) when validating parameters or preconditions of a function to indicate that whatever
    called the function did so erroneously.
    Carp, croak

  + The wantarray built-in returns undef to sig- nify void context, a false value to signify scalar context,
    and a true value to signify list context. perldoc -f wantarray
    sub context_sensitive {
  	my $context = wantarray();
  	return qw( List context ) if $context; 
  	say 'Void context' unless defined $context; 
  	return 'Scalar context' unless $context;
     }

     CPAN Want and Contextual::Return distributions from the CPAN offer many possibilities for writing
     powerful context-aware interfaces.

  + Best practice is to not use a & sigel on function and do use ()'s.

  + our in package still gives var lexical scope - but allows access by fully qualafied name outside package.

  + local
    Can only local global and package vars
    Use to change a global var for a temporary period. Useful with magic vars.

  + state
    Can do initialization and keeps persistent value between calls to function
    If set as a paramater - first time sets - other times odon't change.

  + Can use idiom dispatch tabe to build table of functions and call them.

    + Tell if a function is named or anonymous, whether through caller() or the CPAN module Sub::Identifyâ€™s
      sub_name() function.

  + Closures

    sub make_iterator { my @items = @_;					Returns an anonymous function iterate over 
  	my $count = 0;							values. values frozen into code.
  	return sub {
  	return if $count == @items; return $items[ $count++ ];
  	} 
    }
    
    my $cousins = make_iterator(qw(					Values persiset
  	Rick Alex Kaycee Eric Corey Mandy Christine Alex
    ));

    say $cousins->() for 1 .. 6;

    Can use to make iterator for expensive value and only call when need value.

  + Attribues
    variables and functions in Perl can have attributes.
    my $fortress :hidden;

    Looks for a hidden atribute handler when parses the code.

    Still experimental. 

    Use attributes pragma, Core module Attribute::Handlers is much easier to use, and Attribute::Lexical is a
    newer approach.

    Problem is they can make code very confusing to understand.

  + AUTOLOAD - if used  -called when function not find. Can generate function on the fly.


* Chapter 6 - Regexp 

  + The qr// operator creates first-class regexes you can store in variables
    my $hat = qr/hat/;
    say 'Found a hat!' if $name =~ /$hat/;

    my $hat = qr/hat/; 						Combine expressions into complex
    my $field = qr/field/;
    say 'Found a hat in a field!' if $name =~ /$hat$field/;
    
  + Regexp::English module has good phone number match in module

  + named captures easier to read then numbers
    if ($contact_info =~ /(?<phone>$phone_number)/) { 
  	say "Found a number $+{phone}";
    }

  + Assertions - don't consume any text - Regex anchors such as \A, \b, \B, and \Z
    my $just_a_cat = qr/cat\b/;					Look for at word boundary
    my $safe_feline = qr/cat(?!astrophe)/;			Look ahead - match only if not followed by
    my $middle_cat = qr/(?<!\A)cat/;				negative look-behind assertion
  								not start of line
    my $space_cat = qr/(?<=\s)cat/;				zero-width positive look-behind assertion
    								must occur after space
  + Modifier
    /G - parse all parts of string - starts where last search left off

  + Experimental ~~
    use experimental 'smartmatch';
    a smart match - either side can be number, string, regexp, 
    see perldoc perlsyn 

    
* Chapter 7 - Objects

  * Use mouse
  

* Chapter 8 - Style & Efficacy
  + Writing Maintainable Perl
    + Remove duplication - bugs lurk when once part gets fixed.
    + Name entities well
    + Avoid unnecessary cleverness
    + Embrace simplicity
  + Writing Idiomatic Perl
    + Understand community wisdom
    + Follow community norms
    + Read code
  + Writing Effective Perl
    + Write testable code
    + Modularize
    + Follow sensible coding standards
    + Exploit the CPAN
  + Exceptions
    + Throwing Exceptions - A thrown exception will continue up the call stack until something catches it or
      the program dies.
    + Catching Exceptions - use block form of eval and catch it. Check the value of $@ and copy it to a local
      var immediately - somebody else might throw a exception. Be sure to localize $@ before you attempt to
      catch an exception.
    + Instead of throwing an exception as a string, you may use a referenceâ€”even a blessed referenceâ€”with
      die. This allows you to provide much more information in your exception: line numbers, files, and other
      debugging information. See CPAN distribution Exception::Class.
    + The Try::Tiny CPAN distribution improves the safety of exception handling and the syntax.
  + Pragmas
    + The constant pragma allows you to create compile-time constant values (but see the CPANâ€™s Const::Fast
      for an alternative).


* Chapter 9 - Managing Real Programs
  + Testing
    + Test::More
    + TAP::Harness
  + Reread & implement tests
  + Use Carp
    + The core Carp module extends Perlâ€™s warning mechanisms. Use Carp when writing modules (Modules on
      page 192) instead of warn or die.  
  	use Carp 'carp'; 
  	$ perl -MCarp=verbose my_prog.pl 		# Verbose Mode
  + Use warnings
    + Use no warnings; with an argument list to disable selective warnings within a scope. perldoc perllexwarn
      lists all of the warnings categorie.
    + Make all warnings fatal.
      use warnings FATAL => 'all';
  + Files & Dits
    + Path::Class distribution on the CPAN has a nicer interface. Use the dir() function to create an object
      representing a directory and the file() function to create an object representing a file:
    + The core File::Copy module provides both copy() and move() functions.
    + The CPAN module File::chdir makes manipulating the current working directory easier. If youâ€™re a fan of
      the command line and use pushd and popd, see also File::pushd.
  + Notes on how to create a CPAN distribution.
    + How to create, upload a distribution.
    + Tools to help create one.
  + UNIVERSIAL
    + VERSION() method
    + DOES() Method
    + can() Method
    + isa() Method
  + Generating Code
    + Force Perl to run codeâ€”to generate other codeâ€”during compilation by wrapping it in a BEGIN block.


      

  

* Chapter 10 - Perl Beyond Syntax

* Chapter 11 - What to Avoid
  + Bare words - use when can.
    + Keys to hash, etc.
      + To force a function - use ( )'s for parms to function.
      + prepend a +
    + The special named code blocks AUTOLOAD, BEGIN, CHECK, DESTROY, END, INIT, and UNITCHECK are barewords that
      declare functions without the sub built-in.
    + Always quote values of a hash

* Chapter 12 - Next Steps with Perl
  + Look at some CPAN modules
    * Access a database via SQL, use the DBI module.
    * Embed a lightweight, single-file database, use the DBD::SQLite module. 
    * Manage your database schemas, use Sqitch.
    * Represent database entities as objects, use DBIx::Class.
    * Perform basic web programming, use Plack.
    * Use a powerful web framework, use Mojolicious, Dancer, or Catalyst.
    * Process structured data files, use Text::CSV_XS (or Text::CSV).
    * Manage module installations for applications, use Carton.
    * Manipulate numeric data, use PDL.
    * Manipulate images, use Imager.
    * Access shared libraries, use FFI::Platypus.
    * Extract data from XML files, use XML::Rabbit.
    * Keep your code tidy, use Perl::Tidy.
    * Watch for problems beyond strictures and warnings, use Perl::Critic.
