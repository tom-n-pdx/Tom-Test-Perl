Notes Object Oriented Perl

Object Oriented Perl by Paul Fenwick and Jacinta Richardson, 2007,  Perl Training Australia, Version 1.11

Book was writen for Perl 5.8.8

Chapter 3
* Figure out use vs. require - this book starts with using require
* To Makethe code run I had to use a full filepath to the lib filepath
* Also had to cleanup characters from cut-paste pdf

* To import from local file not in Lib Path - require works well

Chapter4 - Modules
* modules end in .pm
* import via bareword in use
* checked at compile time, not run time
* a module with use can take arguments for special cases
* Module name Bob::Type - looks for Type in dir Bob - :: = /

* Looks for modules in @INC.
	* Modify PERL5LIB - but - with taintcheck turned on ignored
	* Call with perl -I/path  to add a lib
	* use lib "/path/to/libs";   - also adds lib
	* Modify @INC DOES NOT WORK  -happens at runtime but use loads at compile time
	
* perldoc perlmodlib 	- list core modules
* perldoc perllocal  	- lost locally installed modules (may miss some in OS installed areas)
* perldoc module		- provides docs for the modue

* use perl -c MyTest.pm	- test if code compiles ok but not run

* Can export things from module into main namespace -don't. See perdoc Exporter.

* somehow can use import to read paramaters from the use line
