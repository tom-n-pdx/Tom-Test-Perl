* Ideas
  + Match files Org with fixed
  + For original files that are converted, watermark or no cover - look for better version on lib genesis.
    Scan subset original files. Look and see how many same files on lib genesis. Download and check of better.
    + Need detect watermark automatic
    + Need detect if have cover automatic
    + Need detect if converted automatic
    + 



* Design Database
  + How do we handle a book with same md6 in multiple database?
  + MD6 of a file is a "implementation" of a book
  + Book has title, edition, etc - not extension or md6
  + Implementation of book has unique md6, extension type, scanned or not, true pdf or not
  + Do I need to store info on where book is or just a link to one good database?
  + 

* Things Manually Fixing
** General
   + Edition - Ed.
   + Fix authors with _ in list
   + Fix %es2 - etc encoding in file name
   + Replace . with space in file name
** Publisher
   + Haravard Business Review - HBR
   + DK Publishing - DK

   + Oxford University Press - Oxford
